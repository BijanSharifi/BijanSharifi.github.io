Uses multiple hashmaps to store a word with it appropriate language, translations, and parts of speech. Given that the lexicon has inputed word, and the targeted languages part of speech structure, this translator translates the sentense but also makes sure it follows the appopriate gramatical structure of that language according to rules.  </div>

This program performs the algorithm to turn any NFA into a DFA. Function is written by using a set of helper functions that help break this problem down into smaller parts. Some of the helper functions include move, eclosure, and finding new states and transitions as the subset construction steps. A regular expression can also be defined in 5 "fields" as well. A regular expression contains some combination of the following: empty string, chars, unions, concatination, and Kleene star. This function converts a regular expression to an NFA, because any regex can be represented by an NFA.</div>

Starts off by creating a tokem list of all the inputed words to make sure they are valid, then uses the parser to make sure it gramatically makes sense, then finally gets evaluated using the interpreter to make sure the meaning of the line makes sense. </div>
